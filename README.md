#MYO Scripts

The purpose of this repo is a place to share all the scripts I create to be used with the Thalmic MYO armband.

If you need any info on developing for the MYO please refer to the [MYO Developer page](https://developer.thalmic.com/docs/api_reference/platform/getting-started.html).

#Scripts
## MYODeck

This is as simple as it gets. I wanted a way for me to control my presentations from Deckset using the myo armband.

###How to use:
- Open up deckset
- Press play
- `Wave In` to go backward
- `Wave Out` to go forward
- Amaze everyone with your jedi tricks and rock your presentation!
